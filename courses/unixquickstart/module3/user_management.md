Execution of User Management Commands 

Linux is multi-user operating system, when we work on servers its always the case where its access is given to many users with certain permissions.

Permissions of users can be like whether he can access certain directories or services.

In this lesson we will learn how to do user management.

To perform user management activites you will need access to the root permissions or at least sudo permissions are needed to your user which you are logged in with. 

Lets start with simple commands and then go the advanced 

### who 

We can use who command to check who all are logged on to the Laniux Server/ Desktop. 

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-49:~$ who
ubuntu   pts/0        2022-02-23 05:43 (15.206.23.229)
```

We get following output from the command

1. User name who loged in i.e in our case is ubuntu 
2. How users are joined in i.e directly on server or from remote computer. If user is joined from remote computer then its pts/0 else it will be shown as like tty or :0  
3. Time when the user is logged in 
4. From which remote IP address user has joined 

Following example show two loggins from the same computer 

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-49:~$ who
ubuntu   pts/0        2022-02-23 05:50 (15.206.23.229)
ubuntu   pts/1        2022-02-23 05:50 (15.206.23.229)
```
### whoami

Most of time you have multiple user access to the system. What if you want to by which user name you have logged in on the system.

So basically you check your user name on the already logged in system.

On server when we check whoami then we get it as ubuntu which is a user name with whom we have logged in on the server.


```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-1-49:~$ whoami
ubuntu
```


Now lets move to command which is mostly used when doing admin tasks.

### su

su is switch user command. Using this you can switch to other user on the terminal. On a give Linux system there might be many users accounts, you can swithc to other user account without need to logout from your existing account. 

Example below shows how we are able to switch from dbit user to ubuntu user. 

```
dbit@Tayyabali:~$ su ubuntu 
Password: 
ubuntu@Tayyabali:/home/dbit$
```

As you can see on the command prompt 

For this to work you should have the other users login access permission.

Notice the prompt ```dbit@Tayyabali``` gets changed to 
As you can see we had logged in user dbit account on Tayyabali Computer. 
when we switch to ubuntu user our promt gets changed to ```ubuntu@Tayyabali```

To log out from ubuntu user simple use ```exit``` command.

We can also use the su command with -c option to run a command with given users previllege. You can try that with as shown following syntex

su â€“c [command] [other_user]

Lets execute whoami command using above syntex

```
dbit@Tayyabali:~$ su -c whoami ubuntu
Password: 
ubuntu

```

As you can see the output commands are executing with ```ubuntu``` users previleges.


### sudo 

sudo command (SuperUser DO) in Linux allows you to get temporary previlages and run the commands. 

You can use the ```sudo``` before the command and execute it as shwon below


```
ubuntu@Tayyabali:~$ sudo ls
[sudo] password for ubuntu: 
ubuntu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
```
We have executed the sudo ls command under the user ```ubuntu```. Since this user is not added in the sudoers file his user cant execute commands with sudo.

To add user to sudoers group you can use any of the following,

1. Using user mode command ```sudo usermod -a -G sudo <user>```
2. Using the gpasswd ``` sudo gpasswd -a <user> sudo```
3. Using visudo ``` sudo visudo```

Once you add the ubuntu user to sudoers group then ubuntu user can execute the commands with sudo as shown below 

```
ubuntu@Tayyabali:~$ sudo ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures	Public	Templates  Videos

```

### login 

login command is used to login into the system. On Ubuntu system you need to be root user to login from terminal. 
When you login if username is not provided it will ask the username and password.

Lets see example of login 

```
dbit@Tayyabali:~$ login
login: Cannot possibly work without effective root
```

When you are logged in with regular user it will give such error messages

Using the sudo su root we switch to root user, you can also use only ```su root```. 

```
dbit@Tayyabali:~$ sudo su root
[sudo] password for dbit: 
root@Tayyabali:/home/dbit# 
```

Once you login using root notice the prompt is changed to ```#```

Now lets try login command 

```
root@Tayyabali:/home/dbit# cd 
root@Tayyabali:~# login 
Tayyabali login: dbit
Password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.13.0-30-generic x86_64)

```

If you dont specfy user ten it will ask you user name along with password also.

To logout simple use ```exit``` command or logout command. 


### passwd

passwd commmand is used to change the password on command line 

In Linux two files are used to manage the users on the system they are /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd. we will see the use of these files and how the user/groups information is stored. 


### useradd

### useradd 

### usermod

### userdel

### groupadd

### groupmod

### groupdel

### gpasswd

### chown

### chage

### chgrp

### chfn
