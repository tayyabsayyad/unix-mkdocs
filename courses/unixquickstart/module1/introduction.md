### Why you learn commands 

You might have this question why to learn commands if you can manage everything using the graphical interface.

Following are some of the reasions why you must consider learning command line

+ Commands you give you better control over the system than just the GUI which is always limited 

+ Command line is direct interface with the Linux system faster than GUI mode

+ You can automate repeated tasks, for example, converting image files to specific sizes or deleting temporary files from computer etc.


Ruslan Osipov in his blog titled `Power of Command Line` gives very nice example. 

Using graphical interface to back up files you will follows steps as given below

```
Right click file.
Left click on “Copy”.
Right click on some empty space.
Left click on “Paste”.
Right click on a newly created copy.
Left click on “Rename”.
Switch to a keyboard.
Type file.bak.

```

If you do the same opration on command line then you have to just run following command 

````
$ cp file{,.bak}
```
